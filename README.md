# Virtual-QuickSort
Virtual QuickSort implements a modified Quicksort algorithm to sort binary file records (4 bytes each: 2-byte key and 2-byte data). It uses a buffer pool with LRU replacement for efficient file access. Optimized pivot selection and hybrid sorting ensure high performance, balancing in-memory sorting logic with disk-based operations.
